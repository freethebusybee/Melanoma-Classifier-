# Melanoma-Classifier-

Features: ðŸ§´ðŸ§´ðŸ§´

This project leverages machine learning and deep learning technologies to classify skin cancer images as either melanoma or non-melanoma. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on preprocessed image data, achieving binary classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with data augmentation applied to enhance the model's robustness. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function. A Shiny web application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying classification results, making the tool accessible and practical for real-world use. This project demonstrates the integration of advanced machine learning techniques with web technologies to address a critical healthcare challenge.
